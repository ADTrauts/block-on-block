# Drive Product Context

## 1. Header & Purpose

**Purpose:**  
The Drive module is the core file management and storage solution for the Block on Block platform. It enables users to securely upload, organize, share, and collaborate on files and folders within a unified workspace. Drive is designed to support both individual and team workflows, providing granular permissions, real-time updates, and seamless integration with other modules (e.g., Chat for file sharing, Dashboard for widgets, Marketplace for module attachments). The Drive module prioritizes accessibility, extensibility, and a user experience inspired by leading cloud storage platforms.

**Cross-References:**  
- See also:  
  - [chatProductContext.md] (file sharing and references)
  - [dashboardProductContext.md] (Drive widgets and integration)
  - [marketplaceProductContext.md] (future: module attachments)
  - [systemPatterns.md] (navigation, modular context)
  - [designPatterns.md] (UI/UX, sidebar, and layout patterns)
  - [databaseContext.md] (data model and relationships)

## 2. Problem Space
- Users face fragmented navigation and lack a unified workspace for file management in traditional ERP/LRM systems.
- Switching between folders or modules disrupts workflow and reduces productivity.
- There is a need for persistent access to files, folders, sharing, and permissions regardless of where users are in the app.
- Personalization and quick access to frequently used files/folders are often missing in legacy file systems.

## 3. User Experience Goals
- Consistent, accessible UI across devices.
- Robust search and filtering for quick file access.
- Clear feedback for all actions (uploads, sharing, errors, etc.).
- Personalization: users can organize folders, star files, and manage their own Drive layout.

## 3a. Panel-Based Layout & Navigation

The Drive module uses a panel-based layout for file and folder navigation, preview, and management. Typical layout structure:
- **Left Panel/Sidebar:** Folder tree, quick access, starred/recent/trash
- **Main Panel:** File/folder grid or list view, file previews
- **Side Panels (optional):** File details, sharing settings, activity log
- **Panel Features:**
  - Panels are resizable and collapsible
  - Drag-and-drop file/folder operations
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## 4. Core Features & Requirements
- File/folder navigation (grid/list view, breadcrumbs, sidebar).
- File/folder upload, download, rename, move, delete, and restore from trash.
- File/folder sharing with granular permissions (view, edit, share).
- **Folder permissions**: Complete permission system matching file permissions (canRead, canWrite).
- **Share links**: Automatic generation for non-registered users with user-friendly modal.
- **Direct link access**: Share links (`/drive/shared?file=xxx` or `?folder=xxx`) display specific items.
- File/folder preview (images, documents, etc.).
- Real-time updates via sockets for collaborative changes.
- Search and filter functionality.
- Activity log for file/folder actions.
- Modular, type-safe UI components.
- Integration with other modules (e.g., file sharing in Chat).
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Secure, role-based access control.

# Cloud Storage Support (Google Cloud Storage) [2024-06]

## Product Requirements
- The Drive module must support Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as a backend for all file and folder operations (upload, download, delete, preview).
- The storage backend is selected via environment variable (`STORAGE_PROVIDER`).
- All user-facing file operations must work seamlessly whether using local or GCS storage.
- File URLs and previews must be compatible with GCS (e.g., use signed URLs for private files).
- User avatars and other file assets should also be stored in GCS when enabled.

## User Experience Implications
- No change in user workflow; all file operations remain the same from the user's perspective.
- Improved reliability, scalability, and performance for file storage when using GCS.
- File sharing and previews in Chat and other modules must work with GCS URLs.

## Developer Notes
- All file storage logic must use the storage abstraction layer.
- Test all file operations in both local and GCS modes.
